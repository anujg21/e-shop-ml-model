### Problem
An online clothing retailer has clickstream data that contains information about user clicks, purchases, and other interactions with the retailer's website. The objective is to use this data to gain insights into user behavior, predict whether a user will make a purchase based on their clickstream data, and predict the total revenue generated by the website.

### Solution
The CRISP-DM method is used to structure the data analysis, and the eshop dataset is used to compare various classifiers.

### Important Finding
The dataset used contains many important findings such as a strong positive correlation between month and session ID, a negative correlation between price and page 1 (main category), and a negative correlation between price and price 2. Countries outside of Europe have also seen e-shopping from this website, but the contribution is more negligible. Customers seem to be interested in neutral colors like black, blue, gray, white, and brown. Placements of pictures matter a lot, and it's possible that the dataset contains images of models in different poses. The website got the most visitors from the European countries Poland, Czech Republic, and Lithuania. Trousers are the most purchased product from the website, following the blouses, sale, and skirts.

### Future Enhancement
In the future, this project can be enhanced by adding more features to the dataset and exploring more classification models such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The data can be improved by collecting more detailed information about customers, such as their profession, income, and age. Additionally, more analysis can be done on the website's products and the customer's preferences to gain deeper insights into their behavior. Finally, the website can use the results obtained from this project to improve its user interface, increase sales, and optimize its marketing campaigns.
